# dots
My dotfiles

I will add a good README later. Also this repo is kind of a clusterfuck, that I will probably solve by merging everything to master and making it work on all of my machines with some bash magic

Symlink files from this dir to places where your configs should be. I will probably provide a bash script that can do this automatically

In polybar you will need to change networking interfaces according to your ifconfig
